Start of a program to do a set of comparisons.

Finds surface residues on the first provided PDB file and uses each in turn as the centre
of a patch. Generates the patch and creates a matchpatch surface file.

Currently compares that against a matchpatch surface across the whole (same0 PDB file.

Need to update this to compare against a different PDB file (or set of them)
